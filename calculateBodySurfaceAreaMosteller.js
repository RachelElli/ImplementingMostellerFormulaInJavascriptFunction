This function is used to calculate an approximate body surface area for a person given their height and weight by implementing the Mosteller formula.
It is the square root of the height(in centimeters) multiplied by the weight(in kilograms) divided by 3600.

This function supports heights in units of centimeters, meters, inches, and feet + inches.
This function supports weights in units of pounds, kilograms, and stone.

You need to specify the units and provide them according to the Unified Code for Units of Measure (UCUM) standard.

https://loinc.org/usage/units/

This link is pretty dated but I believe the codes are still accurate.

height 2 should not be used unless you're entering in feet and inches separately.
I always set it to 0 so I don't forget about it shift everything to the left accidentally.
